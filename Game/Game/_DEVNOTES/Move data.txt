Moves

we have four types of moves
1st is active
2nd is passive
3rd is seed
4rth is bloom

Now actives and passives are unlocked as you level up seed moves
seed moves continue to unlock moves and skills.

example

Smash seed(spending soul fragments)
once you reach a certain tier you unlock skills
now skills that do this a seed. certain moves 
evolve like this.

smash seed improves by talking to Luku
 and making a soulberry. these berries give soul energy to the main soulbar
 which the player can choose to allocate exp to a seed or a bloom.

blooms are advanced moves that are stronger.

example smash is tier1
but because its a seed it gets a secondary bar for a different kind of exp.
when that bar fills up it gains a soul level this reaches a certain range like for example
smashes SL= 200 a new branch appears.
